            <h3>Web development</h3>
            <p>In 2017, I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a major in Psychology and a minor in Spanish. I started a position at a data services startup that does a lot of work creating datasets for Natual Language Processing projects. (for those of you unfamiliar with NLP, it is essentially the branch of artificial intelligence that teaches computers how to read). In that experience, I was exposed to huge datasets that required constant data managment techniques. Through this, I began to learn Python bit by bit and soon it became my favorite part of my day. This realization brought me to Web development! I have spent the past several months delving deeper and deeper into WebDev and I am exited to continue to add to my toolbox!</p>
